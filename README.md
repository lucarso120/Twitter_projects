# A Bot for tracking the Portuguese Parliament actions

The purpose of this project is to create a twitter account that automatically updates parlamentary activity as they are published in the official website.
For this, I did some we scrapping to retrieve data from the website, using BeautifulSoup4.
Finally, I extract the useful information and connect via twitter API, using library Tweepy.
